# This lcmaps config will make use of Brian Bockelman's "MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH" plugin, that fixes the htcnodor issue of 
# bind mounting /tmp in the job directories only with the user permissions, thus causing glexec to malfunction and 
# error out with this kind of error :
#
#Feb 15 05:39:21 wn274 glexec[97852]: Failed to write proxyfile /tmp/x509up_u4981.glexec.17556.
